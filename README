# Automated Wi-Fi Network Simulation Setup using mac80211_hwsim

This script automates the setup of a Wi-Fi network simulation using `mac80211_hwsim`, namespaces, and `wpa_supplicant`/`hostapd` on a Linux system. It allows you to create virtual Wi-Fi radios, assign them to network namespaces, and simulate multiple stations connecting to an access point (AP).

# WiFi Simulation Setup Script

This script automates the setup and management of a WiFi simulation environment using `mac80211_hwsim`, network namespaces, and tools like `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`. It allows the creation of virtual radios, assigning them to network namespaces, and simulating a WiFi network with one AP and multiple stations.

## Features

- **Invoke mac80211_hwsim**: Create a specified number of virtual radios.
- **Create namespaces and assign interfaces**: Set up network namespaces and bind each virtual radio interface to a namespace.
- **Run AP**: Configure and run an Access Point (AP) on the first available virtual radio interface.
- **Run STAs**: Run multiple stations (STAs) in their respective namespaces.
- **Clean up**: Terminate all running processes, delete namespaces, and remove the `mac80211_hwsim` module.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and properly configured on your system:

- Linux with kernel support for `mac80211_hwsim`.
- `iw` for managing wireless devices.
- `iproute2` for network namespace management.
- `hostapd` for configuring and managing the AP.
- `wpa_supplicant` for managing the STAs.

## Script Options

### 1. Invoke mac80211 hwsim with N radios

This option initializes the `mac80211_hwsim` module with the number of radios specified by the user. At least 2 radios are required (1 AP + N stations).

### 2. Create namespaces and assign interfaces

This option creates network namespaces and assigns each PHY interface (except the first one, which is reserved for the AP) to a separate namespace. The script will automatically determine the available PHY interfaces and create the appropriate number of namespaces.

### 3. Run AP on the first available PHY interface

This option configures and runs an AP on the first available PHY interface (wlan0). The AP is assigned a static IP address (`192.168.42.1/24`).

### 4. Run STA on the namespaces

This option runs `wpa_supplicant` in each namespace, effectively simulating the stations connecting to the AP. Each STA is assigned a static IP address within the `192.168.42.x/24` subnet.

### 5. Clean the network and namespaces

This option stops all running `wpa_supplicant` and `hostapd` processes, deletes the namespaces, and removes the `mac80211_hwsim` module from the system.

### 6. Exit the menu

Exits the script.

## How to Use

1. Run the script in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ./setup_wifi_simulation.sh
