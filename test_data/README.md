# TCP Performance Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains scripts for analyzing and visualizing TCP performance data collected from multiple stations using `iperf3` and simulated through `mac80211_hwsim`. The scripts provided include:

1. `analysis.py` - For analyzing TCP performance metrics, such as total bytes sent, retransmission rates, and CPU utilization, and summarizing these metrics across different schemes.
2. `tcp_plot.py` - For visualizing TCP bandwidth and retransmissions over time for different schemes, with the ability to plot individual station data and calculate averages.

## Files

### 1. `analysis.py`

#### Description

The `analysis.py` script is designed to process and analyze TCP performance data from JSON files generated by `iperf3`. It performs the following tasks:

- **Per-station Analysis:** Calculates total bytes sent, total packets sent, retransmissions, and retransmission percentage.
- **Combined Scheme Analysis:** Aggregates data across all stations within each scheme, calculating total bytes sent, total packets sent, total retransmissions, combined retransmission percentage, and average bandwidth.

#### Usage

1. **Place the script** in the directory where the scheme directories (e.g., `scheme_1/tcp`, `scheme_2/tcp`, `scheme_3/tcp`) are located.
2. **Run the script** using Python:

   ```bash
   python3 analysis.py
